# Solution Approach

I started with the build tool Parcel Boilerplate to create
the project infrastructure however pulled out all
references to Bootstrap as this framework was not to be used.

I then built the nav at desktop and focused on the responsive nav at mobile size.
I build the front page using HTML5 tags and the Sass preprocessor for styling.
I continued to build the Albums listing and styling.

# Test

Apple album search
Build a apple album search UI using React/Angular/Vue based on the invision prototype. Your app should takes one text input as the album name and renders search results from the iTunes API showing each album name and release date.
Note:
* Complete the test without using any third party Javascript/CSS libraries like Material UI, Bootstrap.
API
